Data Scientist,$74K - $105K (Glassdoor est.),"ADM is seeking candidates for the position of Data Scientist to assist and lead in the evaluation of energy efficiency programs.
ADM is a professional service corporation providing energy efficiency program evaluation and research for electric and gas utilities and other clients across North America for over 40 years. Our evaluations are a critical aspect of energy efficiency program design and implementation; we collaborate with clients and program implementation contractors to achieve real-time, transparent evaluation. Our collaborative approach is an integral part of successful programs that decrease ratepayer energy bills while also achieving environmental goals such as deferring fossil fuel power plant projects.
ADM is based out of Sacramento, CA, with satellite offices in Fremont, CA, and Reno, NV. We have remote staff working all over the country and currently provide each employee the opportunity to develop an in-office/work from home schedule that best fits their lifestyle, client needs, and career development.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.",4.1,"Pros
